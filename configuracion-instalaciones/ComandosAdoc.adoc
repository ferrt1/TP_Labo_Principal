Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.

"`Wait!`" Indigo plucked a small vial from her desk's top drawer and held it toward us.

The section <<Iconos>> describes how to insert images into your document.

The section <<Iconos2>> describes how to insert images into your document.

Learn how to <<Iconos,use attributes within the link macro>>.

[#Iconos3]
=== Ejemplo1
Here’s an example of a section with a custom ID and reference text:

[[tiger-subspecies,Tigers]]
=== Ejemplo2
The ID can be written using the following shorthand (though there’s no shorthand yet for the reference text):

[#Iconos2,reftext=Iconos]
=== Ejemplo3

== Imagenes

You can use the imagesdir attribute to avoid hard coding the common path to your images in every image macro. The value of this attribute can be an absolute path, relative path, or base URL. If the image target is a relative path, the attribute’s value is prepended (i.e., it’s resolved relative to the value of the imagesdir attribute). If the image target is a URL or absolute path, the attribute’s value is not prepended.

Example 38. Block image macro

:imagesdir: ./img
image::vogellacompany.jpg[vogella Company]

image::sunset.jpg[]
